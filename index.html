                This project was made after the "Pykemon" game in the course
                "Programming 2". This time I was not about to go to the extremes
                as previously, therefore I made quite a smaller game. This game
                where suppossed to be all a bout farming.I implemented a player
                with gridbased movement, tilemaps from a program called tiled, a
                camera that follows the player and made a light system. But the
                game did not get so far since I got a lot of different
                schoolwork to do that year. I am proud of what I did since I
                also made all the art myself.

                This is a project that I made in a course called "Programming 1"
                during my school years. It was a game made in Python using
                Pygame that was supposed to be more or less a copy of Pokemon,
                hence the name "Pykemon". I got to say that this was one of my
                favorite programming projects to this day and it thought me a
                lot of great things that have stuck with me through the years.

                and asked if I could create the most simple website in the
                shortest amount of time. They just wanted to show a few images
                of their menu and thats it. So I made a small and simple website
                that does just that, display some images.
