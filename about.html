                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Theo Esberg and I am a System Developer from Sweden. I am 20 years old and love to program. I have an obsetion of learning new things, understanding how different things work and how they are done.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On my freetime I love to code new projects, hang out with my buddies, work with my vehicles and play my guitar.
                    Working on cars and playing music is another passion of mine other that programming.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>For the past 6+ years I have worked within the resturant bussnies. After working at two different resturant bussnieses I wanted to start a bussnies myself.
                    I decided to start an Icecream Foodtruck located in Sweden. In late 2022 I pulled the trigger and actually got my bussnies started. Im currently in the works of 
                    getting everything done for the launch in the summer of 2023.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As I said before I love to learn new things. An example of that is my Phone App that is on Google Play Store. I wanted to know how to actually create a phone game
                    and publish it to Google Play Store. In this project I also learnt how to use Unity Ads to generate revenue from my game.
                </p>

            <div class="text-container-2">
                <h1>What are my goals and projects?</h1>
                <p>I am a person with many goals and projects in the works at the same time where some of my goals are more ambitious than other.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My main goal for 2023 is to get my bussnies started in the summer. The goal of this project is to learn how to get a bussnies started,
                    what rules and laws there are that needs to be followed and how it works with everything around it. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Another one of my goals this comming year is to realse a video game to Steam. I currently have no idea of what game I want to create 
                    or if this is even a resnoable goal. But anyways the ability to understand steamworks multiplayer and Steam with Unity in general is worth 
                    a try in my opinion!
